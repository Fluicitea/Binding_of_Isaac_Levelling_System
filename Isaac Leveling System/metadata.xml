    <description>Leveling system for Binding of Isaac. 
Level up by killing enemies, but beware, as your most powerful adversaries are also improving while you are.

Features:
-Level up your characters by gaining experience from kills.
-Each level, you recieve 5 stat points which you can allocate how you wish.
-Bosses increase their damage and their health based on your current level.
-Critical system: chance to get a critical hit dealing double, triple, or quadruple damage (based on which type of critical hit you did).
-Health overhaul: the heart based health from the base game has been replaced by a numerical system, which can be increased with no limit.

Note: to access the stat menu and increase your stats, press &quot;T&quot;.
